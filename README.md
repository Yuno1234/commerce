## Description
An eBay-like e-commerce auction site where users can post their auction listings, bid on them, leave comments on the listings, and add items to a personalized watchlist. For this project, I used Django data models for the first time, which initially presented challenges as I was unfamiliar with creating a database using OOP instead of queries. I struggled to search for data types and properties I needed as I had no prior experience with NoSQL databases. However, after successfully creating the data models, manipulating data became much easier and faster than writing SQL queries. Overall, this project served as excellent practice for me to learn Django models and become more familiar with the features I already knew.
